  The Smart Gateway is a key component in your deployment of SignalFx
  Microservices APM: it receives all the distributed traces from your instrumented
  applications, generates metrics for each unique span and trace path, and selects
  the interesting, erroneous or outlier traces to forward to SignalFx. It is
  designed to run within your environment, close to your application, and operate
  reliably and at scale.
